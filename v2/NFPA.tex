From 240.6 Fuse sizing, we choose 15A 250V Fuse
(Page 97)

From 240.4(D)(1) conductor sizing and 210.20(A) Over current protection, we choose 16AWG copper for power(Continuous loads do not exceed 8 amperes.)
(Page 96)(page 58)

From 250.119(A) equipment grounding and 250.122(A) Size of Equipment Grounding Conductors, as required, we used a wire wrapped with a green insulating layer as ground wire.Considering the type of wires available in the laboratory, we used wires from 18AWG copper as ground wires.

From 310.10(A), our experiments were conducted in a dry environment. Consider the type of wires already available in the laboratory, the type of Insulated conductors we use is MTW
